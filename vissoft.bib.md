  Abstract = {Informed decision making is a critical activity in software development, but it is poorly
  supported by common development environments, which focus mainly on low-level programming tasks. We posit
  the need for agile software assessment, which aims to support decision making by enabling rapid and
  effective construction of software models and custom analyses. Agile software assessment entails
  gathering and exploiting the broader context of software information related to the system at hand as
  well as the ecosystem of related projects, and beyond to include ``big software data''. Finally, informed
  decision making entails continuous assessment by monitoring the evolving system and its architecture. We
  identify several key research challenges in supporting agile software assessment by focusing on
  customization, context and continuous assessment.},
